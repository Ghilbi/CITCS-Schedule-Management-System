## User Guide

### Authentication

When you first access any protected area (Manage Courses), the system displays a login dialog. Enter the administrator credentials provided by your system admin.

• Successful login stores an `authToken` in your browser’s `localStorage` and keeps you authenticated for two hours (token expiry).

If the token is missing or expired the dialog will automatically reappear.
